# Ijzerboer
A retro-style driving game made in Godot.
You're the scrapman and it's your job to make sure everyone's junk metal appliances get picked up in time!

You can try our WIP demo here: [site](https://ijzerboer.brooddoos.xyz).

## Info:
The game will consist of three game modes: a **campaign** where you play the story, a **free roam** where you can explore the map and a multiplayer **derby** where you can race your friends.
The map and concept are set in a rural town somewhere around Antwerp.

## Credits:
The game will be fully coded and modelled by **@j4y-boi** and **@kobegeens**.
